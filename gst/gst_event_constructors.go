// NewQOSEvent allocates a new qos event with the given values. The QOS event is generated in an element that wants an upstream element to either reduce or increase its rate because of
// high/low CPU load or other resource usage such as network performance or throttling. Typically sinks generate these events for each buffer they receive.
//
// Type indicates the reason for the QoS event. GST_QOS_TYPE_OVERFLOW is used when a buffer arrived in time or when the sink cannot keep up with the upstream datarate. GST_QOS_TYPE_UNDERFLOW
// is when the sink is not receiving buffers fast enough and thus has to drop late buffers. GST_QOS_TYPE_THROTTLE is used when the datarate is artificially limited by the application, for
// example to reduce power consumption.
//
// Proportion indicates the real-time performance of the streaming in the element that generated the QoS event (usually the sink). The value is generally computed based on more long term
// statistics about the streams timestamps compared to the clock. A value < 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is producing data faster than real-time. A value > 1.0 indicates that the
// upstream element is not producing data fast enough. 1.0 is the ideal proportion value. The proportion value can safely be used to lower or increase the quality of the element.
//
// Diff is the difference against the clock in running time of the last buffer that caused the element to generate the QOS event. A negative value means that the buffer with timestamp arrived
// in time. A positive value indicates how late the buffer with timestamp was. When throttling is enabled, diff will be set to the requested throttling interval.
//
// Timestamp is the timestamp of the last buffer that cause the element to generate the QOS event. It is expressed in running time and thus an ever increasing value.
//
// The upstream element can use the diff and timestamp values to decide whether to process more buffers. For positive diff, all buffers with timestamp <= timestamp + diff will certainly arrive
// late in the sink as well. A (negative) diff value so that timestamp + diff would yield a result smaller than 0 is not allowed.
